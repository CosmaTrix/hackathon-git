## Concept

In a scenario of a marketing office, political bureau, or fundraising association, the launching of a new campaign and associated hashtag can be monitored throught Philips Hue Light and a web interface.

According to the success of the hashtag in Twitter (for example #philipshue), the lights will be changing color and luminosity. In this way, for example with a wall covered of Philips Hue Lights, not only the office will be informed about the development of the campaign, but also it will influence people's mood and emotions through immediate visible feedback.

## Web interface

The web interface provides detailed information about the success of the campaign.
The title which consists of the campaign hashtag, changes color in real time like the light bulbs.
